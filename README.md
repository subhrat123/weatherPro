                               ..by subhrat verma


This app is created by using react.

It fetches weather data from the api's and display it.
- such as weather conditions,temperature,humidity,heat index,date and time.

I have used two api's for weather fetching data.

 - For current weather data(todays data) 
 - -code in the file   (.src/Context/index.jsx) 

 - For 7 days forecast weather data 
 - -code in the file   (.src/Context/forecast.jsx)
